###This is a docker-based Weblogic application used for learning purposes, meaning learning:
* Docker
* Java EE 7
* Weblogic configurations/extensions
* Weblogic WLST - an amazing scripting tool for setting up the WL server (e.g. JMS, DataSource, Security configuration and application deployment)

#### Steps to run the WL based container and setting it up:
1. run the dockerfiles/buildDockerImage.sh
    
        sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.1 -d -s
        
    **Note:** See the https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic for how to install and run the WL container

1. run the sh script to setup the JMS and deploy the war application

        sh setup_wls.sh
        
1. Access the WL console 

        http://192.168.99.100:8001/console
            username: weblogic
            password: <generated>  
         
    **Note:** The admin password is generated by the docker run command. In order to see it:
     
         $ docker logs -f wlsadmin 
     
             and search for
     
         ----> 'weblogic' admin password: d41d8cd9
            
1. Access the web application:

        http://192.168.99.100:8001/handson-wls
    
       
##### Notes:
* The IP used by host in order to access the WL can be found out using:
    
        docker-machine env dev | grep DOCKER_HOST


##### Many thanks to:
* Bruno Borges (https://github.com/brunoborges) who (among other good thing) created the docker config for Oracle products (DB, WL, java 8 server)

##### Tasks
* Setup the datasource and connect it to the docker-based Oracle DB
* Check the JMS configuration using the SimpleServler and @Inject
* Create a simple JPA entity and a persistence example
* Create a simple REST service and test it
    * with curl
    * from the WEB UI with AJAX

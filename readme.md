###This is a docker-based Weblogic application used for learning purposes, meaning learning:
* Docker
* Java EE 7
* Weblogic configurations/extensions
* Weblogic WLST - an amazing scripting tool for setting up the WL server (e.g. JMS, DataSource, Security configuration and application deployment)

#### Steps to run the WL based container and setting it up:
1. run the dockerfiles/buildDockerImage.sh
    
        sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.1 -d -s
        
    **Note:** See the https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic for how to install and run the WL container

1. Change the 'weblogic' admin user password

    1. create a file named password.secret and type the password. Mark it as git ignore.

    1. run the sh script to change the 'weblogic' admin user  password
    
            sh change-password.sh
        
1. run the sh script to setup the JMS and deploy the war application

        sh setup_wls.sh
        
1. Access the WL console 

        http://192.168.99.100:8001/console
            username: weblogic
            password: <generated>  
         
    **Note:** The admin password is generated by the docker run command. In order to see it:
     
         $ docker logs -f wlsadmin 
     
             and search for
     
         ----> 'weblogic' admin password: d41d8cd9
            
1. Access the web application:

        http://192.168.99.100:8001/handson-wls
    
       
##### Notes:
* The IP used by host in order to access the WL can be found out using:
    
        docker-machine env dev | grep DOCKER_HOST

* In case the weblogic admin password was messedup do the following:
    
    * Connect to wl docker container in bash moe
    
            docker -ti wlsadmin bash
            
    * Follow the steps shown at https://oracle-base.com/articles/11g/reset-the-adminserver-password-in-weblogic-11g-and-12c 
        but:
        
        * kill the wls process (find the process with jps -vl  and kill it with kill -9 <pid>)
        
        * run recover password util with the -cp flag
        
                java -cp /u01/oracle/wlserver/server/lib/weblogic.jar:$CLASSPATH weblogic.security.utils.AdminAccount weblogic <password> .
                
        * start the weblogic
        

##### Many thanks to:
* Bruno Borges (https://github.com/brunoborges) who (among other good thing) created the docker config for Oracle products (DB, WL, java 8 server)

##### Tasks
* Take the password from the password.sercret
* Setup the datasource and connect it to the docker-based Oracle DB
* Check the JMS configuration using the SimpleServler and @Inject
* Create a simple JPA entity and a persistence example
* Create a simple REST service and test it
    * with curl
    * from the WEB UI with AJAX

### Issues
* The JMS ConnectionFactory's subdeployment and target are not correct
